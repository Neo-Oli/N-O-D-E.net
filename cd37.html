                <div id="post">
                <p>Welcome to Cyber Dump number 37, your look at what's happening in this insane age of technology that we live in. As always, all source links mentioned are below.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">DIY</p>

                <p>Starting off, Circuit Digest made a great arduino tutorial, showing you how to create a DIY solar tracker, which automatically follows a light source, for efficient charging. Check out the full guide, with parts and code on their website.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iujJuMYl8l0<br>
                http://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/arduino-solar-panel-tracker</p>

                <p>A user on Hackaday also posted the ZeroPhone project, which aims to be an open source phone using the Pi Zero as the brains. All the parts are readily available, and cost about $50.</p>

                <p>https://hackaday.io/project/19035-zerophone/log/51839-project-description-and-frequently-asked-questions</p>


                <p class="subtitle">VIRTUAL REALITY</p>

                <p>CloudGate Studio uploaded a new VR experiment of what they call full body awareness, which is a way to increase immersion, by displaying the user's whole body in first person view, and not just their arms. Aside from making the user feel like they're in the virtual worlds more, it also opens up new possibilities for interaction mechanics.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYCRDZJkSRk</p>

                <p>Paperstick also showed off their low-tech VR controller, which tracks a printed piece of paper, allowing for simple and cheap hand tracking and trigger mechanics for mobile VR like Google Cardboard.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">DRONES</p>

                <p>More and more drone delivery companies are starting to pop up. This time we have Drone Delivery Canada, which aims to be both a b2b and consumer autonomous delivery service, which they liken it to a railway in the sky. They're currently working in rural parts of Canada.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">AUGMENTED REALITY</p>

                <p>HoloLamp showed off more of their demos this week, going over the various applications they envision for their technology. I'm not sure how the perspective tracking works, especially with multiple viewers, but this looks fascinating.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNdp5WogQ44</p>


                <p class="subtitle">3D SCANNING</p>

                <p>Researchers have developed XROMM, which combines X-ray video and CT scans, to create 100% accurate videos of bones moving in 3D space. Besides medical uses, this looks like it'd be very useful for biomimetics.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BmfeR_BllQ</p>


                <p class="subtitle">ROBOTICS</p>

                <p>Lots of robots this week. First is japanese bot, HOSPI, which is a delivery bot used in hospitals, airports, and hotels. The creators say they hope these kind of robots will begin to fill the empty roles left by Japans declining birth rate.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkAOuyWWjaQ</p>

                <p>NXROBO also showed off a quick demo of their BIG-i home robot, which is like a moving Alexa, which can listen to verbal commands, and perform tasks such as drawing your curtains.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo703grQh64<br>
                http://www.nxrobo.com/</p>

                <p>As well as that, we saw the HiMoveRO, another Japanese bot, this time designed to carry out the various tasks of a science lab technician.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">THIS WEEK ON NODE</p>

                <p>Lots of new stuff on the NODE channel this week. First were two videos going over some really useful tools to help simplify the command line. Check these out of you're a beginner, or have trouble remembering commands.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWmJcVdCdLo<br>
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJBxHMm-Y6E</p>

                <p>I also created a cheap and small DIY night vision camera scope thing, which was created using a modified action camera and some other off-the-shell parts.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAViQ_vyym4</p>

                <p>And finally, I showed off version 3 of the USB condom, which allows you to safely charge your USB devices in any port. If you want to pick one up, they're for sale on the NODE shop. Worldwide shipping is available.</p>

                <p>Also, just wanted to mention that the bitcoin payments are working properly now for those who tried earlier in the week.</p>

                <p>Alright, that's it for this week. Check back for more videos, and thanks for watching.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">VIRTUAL REALITY</p>

                <p>As a sign of the times, South Korean amusement park Everland recently unveiled Robot VR, a new virtual reality attraction which puts users inside battling mechs.</p>

                <p>http://vrscout.com/news/korean-amusement-park-robot-vr/<br>
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax0jmFr6NxE<br>
                https://www.everland.com/web/everland/now/news/1216080_10436.html</p>

                <p>Tested also interviewed the CEO of Dexta Robotics about the Dexmo Haptic Glove which allows users to feel and manipulate objects in virtual reality, using a range of finger tracking technologies and motors.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAy6aRnUslY</p>


                <p class="subtitle">BITCOIN</p>

                <p>This week HodlHodl showed off their testnet demo for their upcoming bitcoin exchange. What makes this project interesting is that the exchange is peer to peer, and also works in the browser, meaning it could potentially make buying and selling bitcoin very easy.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYtglu3ACaE</p>


                <p class="subtitle">AUGMENTED REALITY</p>

                <p>General Electric are using augmented reality with projectors and sensors to help assembly staff create parts, guiding the workers through each step, and analyzing quality in realtime.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er5amSwm9XQ</p>


                <p class="subtitle">ROBOTICS</p>

                <p>I bet many of you have seen this already, but I thought it was pretty amazing. A delivery company in China has a fleet of robots that efficiently move and sort different packages into their correct areas.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QndP_PCRSw</p>

                <p>The Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon have also been researching how robots could help people with disabilities perform tasks like eating.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZqcO6TRXKQ</p>

                <p>In other robotics news, the ROBO-ONE bipedal robot fighting competition was held in Japan last month. You've got to watch the full video, it's awesome.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P62j5FRP-iM</p>


                <p class="subtitle">COMPUTER MUSEUM</p>

                <p>I found this site, the Old Computer Museum, and thought you might enjoy it. It has a timeline on the left, and allows you to look through some of the earliest computers, going as far back as 1970.</p>

                <p>http://oldcomputers.net</p>


                <p class="subtitle">3D PRINTING</p>

                <p>Bolivian teenager Leonardo Viscarra, who was born with one hand, has designed and 3D printed his own prosthesis. Using modified 3D files from Thingiverse, his new hand cost less than $100 to print. This is the power of open source knowledge and decentralized manufacturing.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KYPmCVqAWw</p>


                <p class="subtitle">DRONES</p>

                <p>I've mentioned Zipline before, but they just uploaded a new video showing off their drone system which quickly delivers blood to remote medical facilities in Africa.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNvqOBwLluc</p>

                <p>Vision sensor company Insightness has developed a system which mimics human retina function, allowing it to be used for drone collision avoidance. This sensor compresses the large amounts of visual data, meaning the drones can automatically react very quickly.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAI_ZJOD7zQ<br>
                www.insightness.com</p>

                <p>And speaking of collision avoidance, Flyability have gone a different route, with their drone that can safely bounce into other objects, without damaging or injuring either party.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">VIDEOS</p>

                <p>First video this week is a new interview with free software legend and living meme, Richard Stallman. This wide-ranging discussion covers everything from proprietary software, to digital rights, privacy and more.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0y0oXU8YNk</p>

                <p>The next video is a talk by former leader of Google's self-driving car program, and founder of Aurora, Chris Urmson, and he talks about some of the history of self driving cars, and where it might be heading.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtgBySRrN0Q</p>

                <p>Alright, that's it for this week. I just wanted to say thanks for watching, and see you in the next video.</p>

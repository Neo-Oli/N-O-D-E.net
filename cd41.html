                <p>Welcome to Cyber Dump number 41, your look at what's happening in this insane age of technology that we live in. As always, all source links mentioned are below.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">AUGMENTED REALITY</p>

                <p>A software company called EdgyBees has released DronePrix AR, an augmented reality game which pairs up with DJI drones, to transform your surroundings into a virtual obstacle course. Seems like it's very early stages right now, but could be interesting.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">BITCOIN</p>

                <p>A user on the Bitcoin subreddit recently posted some stats on the growth of Bitcoin that really puts things into perspective. If you were crazy enough to invest $10,000 in Bitcoin in 2010, you'd be sitting on almost $150million today, and many people still believe this is in the early adopter phase.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">3D PRINTING</p>

                <p>MIT have developed a machine which can 3D print structures of buildings. This looks pretty basic at the moment, compared with current housebuilding techniques, and materials, but it'll be interesting to see how these kind of things advance.</p>

                http://news.mit.edu/2017/3-d-printing-buildings-0426</p>

                <p>Undergrads at Duke University have been experimenting with 3D printing to develop custom titanium implants, for potential use in spinal surgeries, allowing bone to grow around them. The students say this technique allows for more bespoke solutions designed specifically for individual patients.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">ROBOTICS</p>

                <p>Robotics company Sarcos and Microsoft have teamed up to develop the Guardian S, which is a snake-like robot aimed at improving safety in industrial settings. This curious form-factor is surprisingly versatile, as it can travel 4 miles, climb stairs, vertical walls, function in water, snow and mud, as well as having 360 video and various sensors.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LWWDc9t0GA</p>

                <p>Researchers at Newcastle University have been developing a bionic hand which sees, learns, and remembers how to grasp certain objects, with the aim to automatically pick up a variety of items much faster than conventional bionic limbs.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</p>

                <p>The people who brought you the strange Sunspring film, with a script written by an AI, are back with It's No Game, a new short film. Again, this one has been trained on scripts from various films genres, in order to come up with it's own original piece.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES</p>

                <p>Google's autonomous car company Waymo recently began testing it's self-driving cars in Phoenix. They've even opened applications up to people living in the area, for a chance to use the vehicles in their everday life. You can apply on their site.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">VIDEOS</p>

                <p>First video this week is a new sit down with Elon Musk, where he talks with TED's Chris Anderson about his thoughts on the future, and all the different projects he's involved with.</p>

                <p>The next video is a 30 minute documentary called Unmanned, which explores the various ways that autonomous systems, AI, and robots could be changing our societies.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">THIS WEEK ON NODE</p>

                <p>This week I made a video on the updated OpenDime bitcoin sticks. I also have a few to give away, so check the video for more details.</p>

                <p>Alright that's it for this week. More coming next week. As always, thanks for watching, and see you in the next video.</p>
